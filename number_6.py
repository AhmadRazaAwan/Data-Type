# We can create Fraction objects in various ways. Let's have a look at them.

import fractions

print(fractions.Fraction(3.5))

print(fractions.Fraction(1.5))

print(fractions.Fraction(0.5))

# because its not divisible result is in points always
print(fractions.Fraction(1.1))

print(fractions.Fraction("1.1"))
